## 🧭 Project Goal

Many small business owners still track stock using pen-and-paper or Excel. This often leads to:

- ❌ Confusion or misplaced records  
- 📦 Overbuying  
- 😰 Running out of items during peak hours

Most inventory apps today are built for large businesses - bloated with features, difficult to use, or costly.

**This project aims to change that** offer a clean, simple solution that:

- ✅ Lets users **add and update product stock** easily  
- 🔁 Allows **quick quantity adjustments** after each sale or restock  
- 🚨 Sends **low stock alerts** so users can restock in time  
- 📱 **Works on both phone and desktop** without special training
